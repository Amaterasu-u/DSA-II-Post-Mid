/*
Step-by-Step DP Table Update:
Let's focus on i = 3 (the 3rd item) and w = 6 (weight 6):

Exclude the current item:
dp[3][6] = dp[2][6]
If it was possible to achieve weight 6 with the first 2 items, then we can still achieve weight 6 by excluding the 3rd item.
Include the current item (Item 3, weight 1):
We can include item 3 because its weight 1 is less than or equal to 6.
dp[3][6] = dp[3][6] || dp[2][6 - 1]
This means, if we can achieve weight 5 with the first 2 items (i.e., dp[2][5] is true), then adding item 3 will
 allow us to achieve weight 6.
For dp[3][6]:
If dp[2][6] was true (i.e., it's possible to get weight 6 using the first 2 items), or if dp[2][5] was true 
(i.e., it's possible to get weight 5 using the first 2 items, and we can add item 3's weight 1 to reach 6), 
then dp[3][6] will become true.
